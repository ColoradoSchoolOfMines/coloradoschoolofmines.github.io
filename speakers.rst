ACM for Speakers
================

Mines ACM is a computer science club which aims to provide students with industry skills and connections. We do this through "tech talks," various collaborative meetings, workshops, and more!

Tech talks are ~1 hour talks given by CS industry professionals. We don't have any specific requirements about topics, but we encourage creativity from the speaker. Here are some ideas for talks:

- A cool application of technology/a cool project that you're working on
- Teach/talk about a general software engineering skill (good code habits, development processes, etc.)
- A specific library or language that you're excited about (and why we should be too!) 
- Interview/career prep, advice for preparing for industry

After the talk, you can expect a handful of questions and interest from motivated CS students â€” we would love to have you!
