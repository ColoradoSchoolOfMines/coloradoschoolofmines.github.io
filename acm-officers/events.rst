Meetings & Events
=====================

Coming Soon

.. :Owner: Sumner Evans

.. We have four main types of events: weekly meetings, hackathons/competitions,
.. onboarding sessions, service events, and social events.

.. All Events
.. ----------

.. These events have a lot in common as far as logistics go.

.. - **Room:** (Jackson) every event needs a room. Reserve through
..   (aaiscloud)[https://www.aaiscloud.com/COSchoolMines/Default.aspx] under the
..   events tab -> request events option. From that page you can reserve rooms and
..   schedule events. Almost every room will be registrar controlled. Under
..   department, I've been picking CECS.
.. - **Email Notifications:** (Sumner) every meeting needs an email notification.
..   This should go out the day before the event.
.. - **CS Weekly Notification:** (Sumner) every meeting needs to be on the CS
..   Weekly. Email Kelly Knechtel <knechtel@mines.edu> to get events on the weekly.
.. - **Flyers:** (Sumner) every meeting needs a flyer.
.. - **Daily Blast** (Robby) see `Daily Blast`_

.. Daily Blast
.. -----------

.. For every event, you need to submit the it to the Daily Blast. This is done at
.. https://webapps.mines.edu/DailyBlast/Home/BuildDigestItem. I used the following
.. settings:

.. - Department/Organization: Mines ACM
.. - Category: Campus Events / Meetings
.. - Audience: Faculty / Staff and Students
.. - Division: Student Life - Student Activities / Organizations
.. - Title:

..   - For tech talks: **<company> - Tech Talk Tuesday - <talk_title> - FREE
..     FOOD!**
..   - For other events: **<event_name> - FREE FOOD!** (unless there is no free
..     food, then don't add that)

.. - Brief description:

..   - For tech talks: **Join Mines ACM as we host <name> from <company> for a
..     presentation about <topic (can be longer description than title)>.**
..   - For other events: *whatever seems logical*

.. - URL: https://acm.mines.edu/schedule
.. - Check the box to disable the long description, and instead go straight to the
..   URL.

.. Make sure that the event is included on the Daily Blast on Friday and Monday on
.. the week of the event.

.. Meeting Food
.. ---------------

.. :Owner: Colin Siles

.. This is one of the most important responsibilities in Mines ACM.
.. Dr. Camp, the CS@Mines department head, has stated that it is important to her
.. that ACM provides food in order to attract members.

.. Purchasing Food
.. ---------------

.. Keep track of all food purchase amounts, dates, and who paid for them 
.. in the Google Drive (see *Documentation* section).

.. Have the person responsible for scheduling tech talks ask presenters if they
.. are willing to pay for food. If so, either the presenter will order it 
.. themselves, or you will need to order pizza with CS@Mines funds and then have 
.. Carol send them an invoice for however much it cost.

.. From the school, you can either go through the BSO or through the CS department
.. to get money for pizza. In either case, you will be given a special credit card
.. to use. Return the card as soon as you are done placing the order.
.. **You must make sure the purchase is tax exempt, and you must keep an itemized
.. receipt for all purchases.**

.. The BSO requires that no more that 25% of the club's total BSO-funded
.. expenditures be spent on food. Pay careful attention to your budget.

.. Do your best to call Domino's 24 hours in advance. For tech talks, ask for the
.. pizza to be delivered 15 minutes prior to the start of the meeting. 
.. However, with project meetings, it is advisable to have pizza arrive in the
.. middle of the meeting to discourage people from just coming, grabbing food, and
.. leaving. You cannot make tax-exempt orders through the Domino's website, so you
.. **must** place the order by phone. Tip the delivery driver well, but with a 
.. strict upper limit of 20% of the original purchase amount, as that is a BSO rule.

.. How Much Pizza
.. --------------

.. This formula works well: *num_large_pizzas = math.ceil(2.5 * expected_attendance)*

.. You can use past attendance data from Mozzarella to work out the expected attendance.

.. Documentation
.. -------------

.. For each purchase you make, record the date, what was purchased, where it was 
.. purchased, the purchase amount, who paid for it, and the receipt in 
.. `this Google Sheet
.. <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9Olhz9tDXhcTkxhZTF3QjJrYzQ?usp=sharing>`_.
.. Make sure this stays private, only accessible by the officers.
