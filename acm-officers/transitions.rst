Officer Transitions
===================

In order to maintain a good club continuity, we have some predetermined
steps that can be taken around officer election time to make transitions
go a little smoother.

New Presidents
--------------

#. Meet your officer team as soon as possible! Introduce yourself and ensure you know everybody's name and they know yours.

#. Talk specifically with the treasurer and vice president: find a good workflow with what you're doing and what they're doing.

#. Transfer the Google & ACM accounts; the Google account (details found in the Etherpad) should have your personal email and phone number on recovery. 
The ACM account will also need to be updated, and officers need to have an ACM student membership ($20/year).

#. BSO is our governing club body from the school. Join the BSO Canvas page to get updates on what we need to do to continue getting funding and support from SAIL.
