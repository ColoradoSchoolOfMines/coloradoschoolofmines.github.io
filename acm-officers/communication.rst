Communication
=============

Mines ACM isn't just a club, it's a community! Communication
should transcend through all levels: the CS\@Mines department,
the officer team, and the entire club.

Officers
--------

The officer team primarily communicates over Discord. It's
fine to have some notifications silenced, but the officer chat
should always stay on.

No worries if you need to miss a meeting due to exam conflicts, illness, 
or otherwise, but make sure to communicate openly with officers about 
your absense, especially if the meeting is yours to run.

Community
---------

Communication within the community is vital. Encourage
discussion on both CS and non-CS topics in the Discord.

Follow-up with information after every meeting; chances are
people would be interested in seeing the slides, if applicable.
Deliver information on upcoming meetings via both the
mailing list and the Discord announcements.

CS\@Mines
---------

Although this job is primarily done by the current president
and faculty sponsor, officers and members are always encouraged 
to interact with the CS\@Mines department.

Department events happen often that can be advertised or
even helped hosted by ACM. Professors are also usually
willing to do tech talks on their research or other topics.
