ACM Officer Guide
=================

Ensuring the continuity of the club takes work but is completely doable. 
The following chapter is a more elaborate guide to running our Mines ACM chapter smoothly.

In all meetings, we want to strive to make ACM more than a "pizza and homework club" (where ACM is a construct to pay for a dozen people's dinner every other week for no good reason).
Encourage people to talk to one another (other than just their friends) or expect students to work on something, whether it's homework or an ACM project.
