Project Meetings
================

The goal of ACM projects is to give students
an opportunity to work on meaningful projects 
and express their creativity while challenging 
themselves and/or learning new skills. 

Project Requirements
--------------------

Projects are always being tweaked depending on interest
from the club, but here are some general guidelines.

- Projects must have an owner/leader. This ensures organization
  of the project and allows better communication with the officer team.

- Projects must be open to collaboration. People are more than
  welcome to work on personal projects, but official club sponsored
  projects should be open to everybody.

Demo projects at the start of meetings and consider showing off projects 
further at our Final Project Demo Day or even the annual Computing Innovation Fair.

Project Lifecycle
-----------------

Projects are created from talking! If you give people time,
they will come up with projects:

- Each project group is more than welcome to set up work times
  on non-meeting days if they're interested.

- Each project group is encouraged to have a "daily standup" meeting when they meet. 
  Discuss what each member has been working on, what they're going to work on next, 
  and address project issues, questions, and long term goals.

ACM projects naturally lose interest near the end of the semester
due to everybody getting busy. This is ok! Just make sure that
graduating students pass on their projects and confirm that
continuing students want to continue their projects.

As officers running project meetings, be less worried about the production
of a final product and instead focus on people hanging out and working on 
the project - this is where the fun and learning happens!

Meeting Food
------------

Keep track of food purchase amounts, dates, and who 
paid for them in a spreadsheet in the Google Drive.
This helps us better estimate the funding for future years.

We can use our funds from the CS department and BSO for food.
You **must** make sure the purchase is tax exempt, and 
you **must** keep an itemized receipt for all purchases.

BSO requires that **no more that 25% of the club's total BSO-funded
expenditures be spent on food**. Pay careful attention this budget.

This formula works well for the number of pizzas to order: *num_large_pizzas = math.ceil(2.5 * expected_attendance)*
