====================================
Furo supports customisation of the theme's overall look and feel (through theme options) as well as a few per-page tweaks.

This section serves to guide the user with customising Furo-based documentation. This page lists all the theme-specific customisations, as provided by this theme. Other pages in this section provide guidance for making specific customisations when using Sphinx with Furo.
