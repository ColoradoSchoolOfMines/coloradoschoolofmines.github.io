Tech Talks
==========

Tech talks are meetings where ACM invites industry professionals to talk 
about software engineering and technology topics.

Organizing tech talks consists of:

#. Reaching out to companies.

#. Organizing a date and topic and advertising accordingly.

#. Sending a thank you email to the presenter or company.

When the schedule for the year is determined, slots for 
tech talks should allocated. To make it easier 
to schedule other meetings, try to fully confirm tech
talks with companies early. 

If companies pull out late or don't reply, we can
always fill in those days with other meetings.

See our schedule for previous companies, or
consider reaching out to `C-MAPP sponsors <https://mapp.mines.edu>`_.
