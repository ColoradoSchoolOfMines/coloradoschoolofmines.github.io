HSPC
----

HSPC is one of our service events that keeps us running as a
club with SAIL and the larger ACM organization. More importantly,
it's a great opportunity for high school students.
Work with the current HSPC Chair and faculty sponsors to ensure this happens.
Incoming HSPC Chairs will (hopefully) shadow the competition for a year.

Hackathons
----------

We normally go to HackCU every year. Make sure everyone has a ride there
and get a list of people willing to give rides in advance.
Recently, HackCU has said that the competition is limited to only CU students,
but allowed us to come anyways. Confirm over email with them on this.
