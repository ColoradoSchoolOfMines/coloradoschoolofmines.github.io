Advertising
===========

Advertising is a vital part of maintaining the club. The following
page outlines some different forms of advertising to ensure growth
and attendance.

Daily Blast & CS\@Mines Weekly
------------------------------

Make sure to advertise weekly meetings to the `Daily Blast <https://webapps.mines.edu/DailyBlast>`_ system.
Also email whoever is in charge of the CS\@Mines weekly, and they should be willing to advertise our events.

Flyers & Digital Media
----------------------

Coordinate with SAIL and the current Director of Advertising
to make flyers for meetings and post them around the school.
This doesn't need to be done for all meetings, but should 
be done for "headline" events, such as tech talks.

The Director of Advertising should also produce digital flyers,
which can be sent to the current ACM faculty sponsor who will
circulate them with other professors to advertise to classes.

Classes
-------

Present to some or all of the CS core curriculum classes (128, 200, 220, 306) at 
the beginning of every semester. Email the course coordinators to schedule 
times you can come in and give a two minute elevator pitch about ACM.

This is typically done in the first week or two so we can advertise for Celebration of Mines
or other headline events, such as our first tech talk of the year.

Celebration of Mines
--------------------

The Director of Special Events should make sure to reserve a table for Celebration of Mines every year. 
This is a great way to get more students involved and interested in the club.

Some good things to bring:

- Stickers and swag for ACM

- Cool computers (ask previous officers)

- QR codes for the website/Discord

In the past, when we have brought computers to hook up to Mines-provided generators,
we typically need 200W (organizers will ask for this).
