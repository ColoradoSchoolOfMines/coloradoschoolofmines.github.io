Diversity & Inclusion
=====================

The goal of the Mines ACM is not just
to provide meaningful learning and career opportunities
for students, but to also foster a community of CS students.

Welcome new members
-------------------

This goes without saying, but always welcome new members!
People may not be sure what "ACM" is, but it's essentially
our Computer Science club! Introduce new members to
what we do and also ask what they want to get from the club.

If you see a student sitting by themselves at a meeting, 
ask for their name and make an effort to get to know them.
People are friendly - yes, even Computer Science majors!

Social meetings
---------------

Consider hosting social events or simply meetings where people
talk face-to-face instead of being in front of a laptop.

Interacting with other clubs is also a great place to do this:
ACM-W and LUG are adjacent clubs to ACM and should be willing
to coordinate meetings together.

Ask for improvements
--------------------

If people stop showing up to ACM, and are willing to talk about it,
consider asking them why so we can improve in the future.

If people are on the fence about showing up to ACM, ask them
what could make it more interesting or meaningful to them.
We don't want to "lure" people in, but rather just ensure
that our community fits the needs of everyone.
